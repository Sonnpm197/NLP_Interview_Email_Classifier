Thank you for your time and interest in joining the Brightwell team. We appreciate your interest and thank you for the time you spent applying for the role. 
After a careful review of your resume, we regret to inform you that we will not be able to invite you to the next round of the hiring process for the Internship - Data Analyst role. We will keep your resume on hand and if a position opens that closely aligns, we will reach out to discuss more at that time. Thanks again for your interest in Brightwell.
We wish you all the best in your job search.
