Hi Michael Gary Scott,
Thank you so much for your interest in Atlassian and for your application to our Procurement Intern, 2023 Summer U.S. posting.
We did want to let you know that unfortunately, we do not offer U.S. work visa sponsorship to student graduates at this time and will not be able to move forward in either the intern or graduate role interview process.
That being said, we would like to still keep in touch. The information that you provided will be kept with us in case you are interested in future roles at Atlassian. In case you are also interested, we have offices in many other parts of the world including Amsterdam, Bengaluru, and Sydney just to name a few. If any of those locations are of interest, be sure to visit our careers site to learn more https://www.atlassian.com/company/careers. 
If anything on our end changes or we find a match open for you in the future, weâ€™ll be in touch. We may also reach out with info and updates related to your career. In the meantime, best of luck on your job search! 
All the best, 
Atlassian Campus Recruiting
