Hi Michael Gary Scott
We appreciate you taking the time to apply for a position at Fable. Although we strive to respond to each applicant individually, if you don't hear from us within a few weeks, please consider it a temporary rejection. However, there's always a possibility of a perfect match in the future.
We also recommend following us on for updates. We're pretty great (but we might be biased).
Hope to chat soon!
