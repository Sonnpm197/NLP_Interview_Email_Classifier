Hi Michael Gary Scott,
Unfortunately, Reddit has decided not to move forward with your application for Product Management Intern at this time. We understand that this is a disappointing decision, but keep your head up!
Remember that persistence is key, and that it usually takes over 10 introductions to get an offer. We encourage you to finalize your profile with RippleMatch so we can send you personalized matches based on your experience!
Once you complete your profile, we'll send you matches selected based on your profile, major, and experience. Every opportunity we share with you is based on your profile and takes ~5 minutes to complete. We'll also follow up with recruiters on your behalf to make sure you hear back quickly.
Finalize your profile
Best,
Brennan & The RippleMatch Team
