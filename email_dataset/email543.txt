Hi Michael Gary Scott 
 
Thank you for taking the time to apply to the Junior ML Engineer role and your time investing in the application. 
I am sad to let you know that this role has been filled meanwhile and we will not be moving forward.
We are anticipating to have more new roles opening in the near future so if you are still available and interested do feel free to get back to us again!
Once again, thank you for your time and interest in joining Yelp!
 
Regards,
