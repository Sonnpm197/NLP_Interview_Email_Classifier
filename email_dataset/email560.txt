Hi Michael Gary Scott,
We appreciate your interest in working at Patreon and the time you invested in applying.
We have reviewed your application, and unfortunately, we have decided not to move forward in the process at this time. We encourage you to stay in touch with Patreon and reapply as future needs arise. 
Thanks again!
All the best,
The Patreon Talent Team
